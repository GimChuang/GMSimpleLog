# GMSimpleLog
A simple utility to "Debug.Log" on Unity's UI canvas so we can view that in a built application.

# Ouch!!
I found that using [Application.LogCallback](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Application.LogCallback.html) and OnGUI is much  simpler. So this project may not be continued.
